Voting Buddy
www.votingbuddyherokuapp.com v1.0

Overview

The Voting Buddy v1.0 is a web application targeting those who are inspired to get others involved in the political process.  Voting Buddy is a tool to connect the target audience to friends and use Voting Buddy as a means to obtain information about the next election and a messaging service send reminders of election dates to a or many “Voting Buddies.”

Technologies used include

Ruby on Rails
Google Civic Info API for election date, polling location and polling hours
Twilio API for the messaging functionality
PostgresSQL database


I have developed Voting Buddy integrating the Google Civic Info API for election, polling location and polling hours and the Twilio API for messaging service.

Our hope is to improve over time with the growth of Voting Buddy.  This first iteration will be available through Github.
